# Results: refusal-direction reproduction

Reproduction of Arditi et al.'s causal refusal-direction finding (a single
residual-stream direction, estimated as the harmful/harmless mean-activation
difference, causally controls refusal), on two small open-weight models.
Methodology details in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

Only aggregate statistics are recorded here. Raw model completions
(including actual harmful text produced under directional ablation) are
never committed to this repo -- see `results/` in `.gitignore`.

## Held-out validation (final numbers)

Direction estimated on a 200-prompt train split (AdvBench + Alpaca), best
layer selected on a disjoint 30-prompt calib split, causal effect measured
on a disjoint 30-prompt held-out val split. 95% CIs are Wilson score
intervals.

| Model | Condition | n | Refusal rate | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | harmful, baseline | 30 | 100.0% | [88.7%, 100%] |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | harmful, **ablated** | 30 | 0.0% | [0%, 11.4%] |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | harmless, baseline | 30 | 0.0% | [0%, 11.4%] |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | harmless, **direction added** (alpha=1.0) | 30 | 96.7% | [83.3%, 99.4%] |
| SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct | harmful, baseline | 30 | 63.3% | [45.5%, 78.1%] |
| SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct | harmful, **ablated** | 30 | 3.3% | [0.6%, 16.7%] |
| SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct | harmless, baseline | 30 | 0.0% | [0%, 11.4%] |
| SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct | harmless, **direction added** (alpha=1.5, calibrated) | 30 | 40.0% | [24.6%, 57.8%] |

In every case the intervention's CI does not overlap the corresponding
baseline's CI -- the causal effect is real on both models, in both
directions (necessity via ablation, sufficiency via addition).

## Cross-model comparison

| | Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct |
|---|---|---|
| Best layer (of 28) | 23 | 20 |
| Raw direction norm at best layer | 75.3 | 279.6 |
| Ablation effect (necessity) | 100% -> 0% | 63% -> 3% |
| Addition effect (sufficiency), calibrated | 0% -> 97% | 0% -> 40% |
| Baseline refusal rate on AdvBench | 100% | 63% |

Two honest, unexplained-further observations rather than overclaimed
conclusions:

1. **Ablation (necessity) is robust on both models** -- refusal collapses to
   near-zero regardless of how strongly the model refused at baseline.
2. **Addition (sufficiency) is architecture-dependent and much weaker on
   SmolLM2.** The alpha-calibration sweep (below) shows SmolLM2 never
   reaches a clean high-refusal regime at any tested alpha -- it peaks at
   42% before collapsing into degenerate repeated-token output. This isn't
   a missing scaling constant; SmolLM2's raw direction norm is already
   ~4x Qwen's, and even correcting for that, the induced effect stays
   capped. Whether this tracks the strength of Qwen's RLHF-style refusal
   training (a more sharply "linear" refusal representation) or something
   else about the two architectures is an open question, not one this
   reproduction answers.

## Alpha calibration sweep

Addition coefficient (multiplier on the raw, unnormalized mean-difference
direction) swept on a 12-prompt calibration split, disjoint from both the
train and held-out val splits above.

**Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** (best layer 23, raw direction norm 75.3):

| alpha | refusal rate | degenerate fraction |
|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 17% | 0% |
| 0.50 | 67% | 0% |
| **1.00** | **100%** | **0%** |
| 1.50 | 100% | 17% |
| 2.00 | 75% | 92% |
| 3.00 | 17% | 100% |
| 4.00 | 0% | 100% |

**SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct** (best layer 20, raw direction norm 279.6):

| alpha | refusal rate | degenerate fraction |
|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 0% | 0% |
| 0.50 | 0% | 0% |
| 1.00 | 25% | 0% |
| **1.50** | **42%** | **0%** |
| 2.00 | 42% | 0% |
| 3.00 | 17% | 17% |
| 4.00 | 0% | 100% |

Qwen has a wide window (alpha 0.5-1.5) of clean, coherent, high-refusal
behavior before degenerating. SmolLM2 never has a wide clean window --
refusal rate rises only as far as 42% before the model starts collapsing
into repeated-token garbage at higher alpha.

## Known limitations

- The refusal classifier is a keyword/phrase matcher (see
  `src/direction/refusal_classifier.py`), the standard sanity-check metric
  in this literature, not a validated final detector. It hasn't been
  checked against human judgment or an LLM-judge baseline for
  false-positive/false-negative rate on these specific completions.
- n=30 per condition is enough to show the effect is real (non-overlapping
  CIs) but not enough for fine-grained comparisons between conditions.
- Only two small models tested (1.5B, 1.7B params). Whether the
  necessity/sufficiency asymmetry holds at the 7-9B scale used later in
  this project is untested.
